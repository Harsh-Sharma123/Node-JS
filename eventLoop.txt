In Node, the Event Loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations. It allows Node to perform non-blocking I/O operations despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded. It continuously checks the call stack and message queue, executes tasks from stack processing asynchronous operations.

# Features
* An event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them, and then sleeps until it receives more tasks.
* The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task.
* The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.
* The event loop executes the tasks starting from the oldest first.
